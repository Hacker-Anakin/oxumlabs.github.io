        <strong>Virtual Execution Node Intermediate Language (VenIR)</strong><br>
        Introducing Ven, an innovative compiler infrastructure designed to empower you to create your own compilers! Ven stands out by producing exceptionally fast and lightweight binaries for the three major platforms: MacOS, Linux, and Windows. What sets Ven apart is its intelligent conversion of IR code into tokens, followed by extremely aggressive code elimination techniques—not limited to just dead code. Ven's primary goal is to strip down code as much as possible, ensuring that only the essential elements remain. This meticulous process results in minimal and highly efficient binaries that perform at peak speed, enhancing your development experience.<br>
        You can read more about Ven on its GitHub repo <a href="https://github.com/oxumlabs/ven">here!</a>.
